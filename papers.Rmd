#### [COVID-19 Transmission in US Child Care Programs](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2020/10/16/peds.2020-031971) 

##### Abstract: 
Central to the debate over school and child care reopening is whether children are efficient
COVID-19 transmitters and likely to increase community spread when programs reopen. We
compared COVID-19 outcomes in child care providers who continued to provide direct inperson child care during the first three months of the U.S. COVID-19 pandemic versus those
who did not.
